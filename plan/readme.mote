**You have just created {{ name }}, a Cuba application.**

If you are new to Cuba I suggest you to start with a light reading at [The Guide to Cuba](http://theguidetocuba.io/). Also you should check the oficial [Cuba](http://cuba.is) site and the [Readme](https://github.com/soveran/cuba) at the Github repository.

The technological stack also includes:

- [Mote](https://github.com/soveran/mote), a minimal templating engine.
- [Shield](https://github.com/cyx/shield), a simple authentication library.
- [Sequel](https://github.com/jeremyevans/sequel), a flexible data base toolkit.
- [SQLite3](https://github.com/sparklemotion/sqlite3-ruby), an sqlite3 ruby interface.

NOTE: To use SQLite3 you will need to install it along with the development package, i.e In Debian based Linux would be <code>sudo apt-get install libsqlite3-dev</code>.
