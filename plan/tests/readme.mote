Tests
-----

The *tests* directory holds tests for the application.
Here we propose to use [Cutest](https://github.com/djanowski/cutest), but you can change it for any other you prefer.

**Example**

    # tests/
    # ...your code
    scope do
      test "should display homepage" do
        get "/"

        assert_equal 200, last_response.status
      end
    end
    # ...more tests
